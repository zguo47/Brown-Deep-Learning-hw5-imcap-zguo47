This is becasue this assignment, like many NLP models, uses temperature as a parameter in text generation. If the models sampled from  probabilies calculated by simply applying softmax to the logits, then the probability of the most likely word will usually be very high and the models will usually genrate the same, most probable caption every time. We use the temperature as a parameter to even out the probabilites so the model produces more 'creative' captions. This is done by dividing the logits by the temperature parameter before applying softmax. Higher temprature values will give a more creative captiong, while temprature values closer to 0 will be more greedy. Check out [this](https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/what-is-temperature/) article for a demonstration and further explaination of temprature in NLP models.\n"
